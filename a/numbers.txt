Here's a numbered list to check whether we can checkout different commits.
Similar to:
    git checkout refs/changes/######/<change #>
I believe it's going to be similiar to:
    git fetch
    git checkout <remote_branch>

1. Woah, we are making a change here.
2. Here's the second commit on the stack.
3. 
4. 
5.
