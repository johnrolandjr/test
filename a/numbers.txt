Here's a numbered list to check whether we can checkout different commits.
Similar to:
    git checkout refs/changes/######/<change #>
I believe it's going to be similiar to:
    git fetch
    git checkout <remote_branch>

1. I'm changing the first commit.
2. Making a change to PR #2.
3. New "feature" just dropped.
4. 
5.
